Hello Mr. Greene,
I could not figure out how to do the images in the end. Either I was messing something very simple up, or all of the things I tried for the path of the files were all wrong.
This version utilizes letters as a variant of images:
P = Pawn
R = Rook
N = Knight
B = Bishop
Q = Queen
K = King


Note: Castling and En Passant Moves Were NOT Implemented Due to Too Much Time Being Spent on the Structuring and Planning Out of the Code.
